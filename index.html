    <h2>Barney</h2>
    <p class="breed">Dachshund - Mix</p>
    <p>WESTSIDE ADOPTION CENTER: I’m at LexiDog on 6100 SW Macadam Ave. Portland, OR 97239 (503-327-8219). I romp and play all day with the other dogs in doggy daycare so I might be a great fit with your canine family members. My name is Barny and I’m looking for a warm lap to lie on. It takes me a little time to trust new people in new places, but give me a bit and we’ll be great friends. That’s probably how I will greet most new people, but I’ve heard it’s a somewhat endearing trait. I really do enjoy getting daily bouts of exercise, and a Basic Manners class, like those offered here at OHS, would help further boost my confidence in new situations. I’ve come here with the hope of finding my forever home, and you seem like just the type of person I want to spend forever with. How about we visit for a while and see if we’re a match like I think we might be?</p>

    <h2>Dean</h2>
    <p class="breed">Basset Hound</p>
    <p>This is Dean and he came in with his brother Sammy (187889). It would be great if we could find a forever home together! Meet Dean! Dean is a sensitive fella who hasn’t quite gotten used to his new environment. He can be nervous in new situations and prefers to take things slow so he can feel more comfortable in what is happening around him. This little man is looking for a place to call his own and a companion to spend lots of time with. His handsome face and endearing personality will capture your heart and make you ask yourself how you ever lived without him. Is Dean the canine friend you have been searching for?</p>

    <h2>Goldie</h2>
    <p class="breed">Chihuahua - Mix</p>
    <p>I’m Goldie! I couldn’t be more excited about being someone’s new furry friend. I have been looking for someone to spend time with me and hang out! I adore being with people and want to give you all the love you’ll let me! I am more than just a pretty face; I have beauty radiating from inside of me. There are lots of dogs out there but I am one of a kind. I have come a long way to find my forever home, is it with you? Goldie came to OHS through the Second Chance Program from Madera Co. Animal Services.</p>
